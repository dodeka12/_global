		AutoDoc rules
		=============

		For each documentation entry that needs to be generated, Atomineer executes an appropriate
		section of the rules in this AutoDoc section (e.g. for a parameter, the <Parameters> section
		is executed). Execution stops when a match is found and a documentation result is returned.

		Full documentation can be found here:
			http://www.atomineerutils.com/rulesguide.php
	-->
	<!-- Rules for generating auto-documentation text describing a file. The results of
		 executing this rule are placed in %fileDescription% when adding file-header
		 comments.

		 NOTE - If you wish to change the layout and content of file headers themselves,
		 then you need to edit the 'Block Templates (DocXML)' or 'Block Templates (Doxygen)'
		 rather than this file.

		 Full documentation can be found here:
			http://www.atomineerutils.com/rulesguide.php

		 Note that you can delete all the examples, and as long as this section does not
		 end with a <Set> command, Atomineer will "fall through" your custom rules and 
		 use its defaults if your rules do not supply any documentation text.
