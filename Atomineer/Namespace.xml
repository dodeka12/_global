		AutoDoc rules
		=============

		For each documentation entry that needs to be generated, Atomineer executes an appropriate
		section of the rules in this AutoDoc section (e.g. for a parameter, the <Parameters> section
		is executed). Execution stops when a match is found and a documentation result is returned.

		Full documentation can be found here:
			http://www.atomineerutils.com/rulesguide.php

			<!-- Rules for generating auto-documentation for namespace comments. The results of
				 executing this rule are placed in %namespaceDescription% when adding file comments.

				 Full documentation can be found here:
					http://www.atomineerutils.com/rulesguide.php

				 Note that you can delete all the examples, and as long as this section does not
				 end with a <Set> command, Atomineer will "fall through" your custom rules and 
				 use its defaults if your rules do not supply any documentation text.
